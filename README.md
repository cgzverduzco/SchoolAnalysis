# School Analysis Challenge
Challenge Module 4. 
## Overview of the school district analysis:
Every year, the Py City´s school board analyzes their schools. This year the analysis was for the high schools, 9th to 12th grades. The key performance indicators are:

- Average Math Score	
- Average Reading Score	
- % Passing Math	
- % Passing Reading	
- % Overall Passing 
- Spending Ranges (Per Student)

After making the analysis, the school board has notified that data shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth-graders appear to have been altered. The analysis has to be run again taking off the data of this grade and school.
